			<P>
				I am a humble citizen of the County of New York (manhattan), a computer engineer, and a polical activist. 
				For Mr. Vance, I am a fly on the wall therefore I don't have anything to prevent Mr. Vance to push foward his 
				misguided electronic agenda except to go to the ballot box.
			</P>
			
			<P>
				I was a supporter of Mr. Vance's agenda and I believe in many of the thing he is doing; but when it comes 
				to our most basic freedom to protect our data, I can't support him; so here I am looking for a replacement.
			</P>
			
			<P>
				I need help from everyone to get this mouvement; 
				online or in the real world.
